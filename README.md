# Intelligent IDE

An advanced code editor with AI-powered features for automated code generation, testing, debugging, and continuous integration. It is an integrated development environment that leverages artificial intelligence to revolutionize the software development workflow. By combining advanced language models with deep code understanding, Intelligent IDE provides real-time assistance, automates repetitive tasks, and enhances developer productivity across the entire development lifecycle.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Structure and semantic elements
- **CSS3** - Styling and responsive design
- **Bootstrap 5** - UI framework for responsive layouts and components
- **JavaScript** - Core functionality and interactions
- **CodeMirror 5** - Code editor with syntax highlighting and editing features

### Development Tools and Frameworks
- **Bootstrap JS** - For modals, tabs, and other interactive components
- **CodeMirror JS** - JavaScript-based code editor implementation
- **ESLint** - Linting utility for identifying problematic patterns
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- **Reinforcement Learning** - Adapts to your coding preferences through feedback

## Features

### Code Editor
- Line numbering and error indication
- Multi-file support with tabbed interface
- Code folding and code completion (simulated)
- Customizable themes (Dracula theme implemented)

### AI-Assisted Development (simulated)
- **Smart Code Completion** - Context-aware suggestions that understand your codebase, not just syntax
- **Code Generation** - Create code from natural language descriptions
- **Intelligent Debugging** - Automated bug detection with fix suggestions
- **Pattern Recognition** - Learns from your coding patterns to suggest solutions aligned with your style
- **Test Generation** - Create test cases from implementation code 
- **Code Optimization** - Suggest improvements to existing code

### Intelligent Bug Detection & Resolution
- **Predictive Error Detection** - Identifies potential bugs before execution
- **Root Cause Analysis** - Pinpoints the source of errors through advanced static analysis
- **Automated Fixes** - Suggests and applies fixes for common issues with one click
- **Security Vulnerability Scanning** - Identifies and helps remediate security vulnerabilities in real-tim

### Project Management
